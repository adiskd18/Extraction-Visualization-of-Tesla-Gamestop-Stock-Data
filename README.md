# Extraction-Visualization-of-Tesla-Gamestop-Stock-Data
This is a part of the final assignment of the course " Python for Data Science, AI, and Development" offered by coursera.
This code helps users in making better decisions by looking at python generated Dataframes and graphs.
This assignment includes extraction of Stock data of Tesla and GameStop using 'yfinance' and 'requests'. The extracted data is then converted to a pandas dataframe. This 
dataframe is used to plot the graph of History Revenue and History Share Price with respect to date.
Anyone is free to suggest other shorter methods to do the same. Any suggestions to improve the code are appreciated.
